> ### When you look into the eyes of an animal you will see unconditional love.

---

This project consists of help stray cats and dogs to find a long-lasting place to live.
Our goal is to provide social awareness of the amount of stray animals that are abandoned in the streets and provide a solution to it.

---
The page has two records, the user (user: everyone who registers; admin: modified from the database to manage the other users), which ***has password recovery in case you forget it[^1]***, and the record dog/cat, which ***has a map to pinpoint the place where it has been seen[^2].***

There are two lists, one is the list of dogs and cats that anyone can register on the page without being a user of it and the list of users that can only be seen by a user with ADMIN role.
